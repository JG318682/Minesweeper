# MineSweeper
This project is supposed to be modeled after the well known game MineSweeper. Playing this game is very easy and will be very similar to playing the original game

# Getting Started
The latest version of this project is v1.0

When you play, you need to first open the game. Then you will start by selecting a random tile, and then contuine until you have finished the game or you select a tile with a bomb.
